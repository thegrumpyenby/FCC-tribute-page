# FreeCodeCamp — Certification Project #2
Tribute page project created for FreeCodeCamp’s (New) Responsive Webdesign Bootcamp

I may be more of a Star Trek fan at the end of the day, but I thought Han Solo very much deserved a tribute page. ;)

**Published page: [A Tribute to Han Solo](https://thegrumpyenby.github.io/FCC-tribute-page/)**

## Objective
Build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks

See [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-tribute-page-project/build-a-tribute-page) for details on what’s required to pass the tests for this project


*Please note: I originally built this project in my Codepen and simply copied the code over afterwards, hence the lack of commits.*
